I chose to do a site on the *Health Alliance for Austin Musicians* because I am a musician.  When I first moved here in 2003 I got access to healthcare through *H.A.A.M.*  It was very reassuring to know that even though I moved 2,000 miles from home (Massachusetts) I had little to no interruption in coverage.  It almost made me want to get sick.  But I didn't.

Today, *H.A.A.M.* continues to help Austin musicians.  Since music is vital part of Austin's economy, H.A.A.M. is also an inportant resource for the city.  [SXSW](http://www.twcnews.com/tx/austin/news/2015/09/16/south-by-southwest-event-continues-to-boost-austin-s-economy.html) itself brought in more than $300 million, and [ACL brought in more than $100 million in 2012.] (http://kut.org/post/acl-fest-organizers-whats-store-2014).

I like whan *H.A.A.M.* does.  And in creating the site I learned a ton.  Someday I hope to be able to create a site that will do the organization justice.
